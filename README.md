 # markFour Assignment
---

This is my version of the solution for the markFour and markFive assignment.

**Following are some of the highlights from my code:**
1. *A home page with header, hero, skill set, projects, blogs and footer sections*
2. *A project page with header, hero, markOne, markTwo, all assignments and footer sections*
3. *A blogs page with header, hero, two blogs and footer sections*
4. *A dedicated blog page with header, hero, detailed blog and footer sections*
